This project aims to analyze music store data using SQL to gain insights into the music industry and customer behavior.The project uses the following datasets:

1. Employee data: This dataset contains information about all the employees working at the store.
1. Customer data: This dataset contains information about the customers who make purchases at the store.
1. Sales data: This dataset contains information about music sales, including the genre, artist, song, and quantity sold.
1. Artist data: This dataset contains information about artists, including their name, tracks, and genre.
1. Song data: This dataset contains information about songs, including their title, artist, and duration.

The project uses SQL to answer the following research questions:

* Who is the senior most employee in the store?
* Which city has the highest sum of invoice totals?
* Which customer has spent the most money at the store?
* What are the top 10 rock bands?
* How much amount has each customer spent on various artists?
* Which is the most popular music genre in each country?
* Which customer has the highest spending in each country?

The findings of the project can be used by the music store to improve their business operations, such as by stocking more popular items and offering targeted promotions. The findings can also be used by the music industry as a whole to better understand customer behavior and trends.
