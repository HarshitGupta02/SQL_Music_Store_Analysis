The project uses SQL to answer the following research questions:

What are the most popular genres of music?
Which artists are the most popular?
What are the most popular songs?
What are the trends in music consumption?
What are the demographics of music consumers?
What are the relationships between different factors, such as genre, artist, song, and price?
The findings of the project can be used by the music store to improve their business operations, such as by stocking more popular items and offering targeted promotions. The findings can also be used by the music industry as a whole to better understand customer behavior and trends.
